This is a fork of the original [emailjs-mime-codec](https://www.npmjs.com/package/emailjs-mime-codec/v/2.0.8) with a small modification to handle big buffer arrays. This is particularly useful when parsing a MIME email document with an attachment.

Please refer to the original package's documentation for how to use.
